Google Domains Dynamic DNS Updater Windows Client

I created a client to update your Google Domains Dynamic DNS. Feel free to download and try it. You can minimize the app to system tray and it will keep checking for updates in the background every few minutes defined by you. Works with both IPv4 and IPv6. 
Tested with Windows Vista, 7, 8 and 10. Let me know if you find any bugs or any suggestions.
